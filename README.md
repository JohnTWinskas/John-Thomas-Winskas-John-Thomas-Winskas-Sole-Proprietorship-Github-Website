### Promulgation Statement
Regards, 

Just want to introduce myself and affirm/ notify you of my current interest in participating in and learning about CERT Training and Community Emergency & Disaster preparedness.
 After reaching out to a few Escambia County, Pensacola, and Florida Department of Health departmental contacts,with a training/skills list, about the availability of any potential volunteer opportunities; I was pointed in the direction of the BRACE Team, as a possible lead, to the type of opportunity that could fit my skillset & ambitions and could allow me to participate in and contribute to the community. 
With those aforementioned ambitions being the achievement of the following objectives:
Applying these skills, experience, and time toward interests in Emergency Preparedness, Nanotechnology, Biomedical Research, Failure Analysis, and Environmental Safety Best Practices to help achieve, solve, and/or contribute to the objectives, problems, and projects of a team that is able to provide a service to the community and/or society. 
Continuing to learn and educate myself and others about opportunities to help raise awareness of the importance of Emergency Preparedness and Environmental Safety in the fields of  Nanotechnology, Biomedical Research, and the everyday Community.
Raising awareness of the indigent & homeless populations and facilitating communication about how we could encourage civic participation and treatment, from and for, individuals who are struggling or have struggled with poverty, mental health, and or physical health issues.

Respectfully,
John T. Winskas
